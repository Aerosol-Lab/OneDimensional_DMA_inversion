# OneDimensional_DMA_inversion

## 1. Introduction

This repository is devoted to single DMA (or 1d) inversion codes. These codes are needed when the experimental configuration: neutralizer+DMA+CPC is used for measuring the particle size distribution.

## 2. Installation

Download the current version of the code

    git clone git@github.com:Aerosol-Lab/OneDimensional_DMA_inversion.git
    
Python codes requiere installing some special libraries. See the [Python](https://github.com/Aerosol-Lab/OneDimensional_DMA_inversion/tree/main/Python) folder for additional information.

## 3. Examples

Both Matlab and Python folders contain a folder where examples on how to run the codes and interpreting the results are provided.

## 4. Documentation

Both Matlab and Python codes include a folder with documentation. This includes the description of codes and background necessary for their understanding.
